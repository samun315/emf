                Visualize a day when every underprivileged people got home, quality education and healthcare, quality of life. How the imagination will come true?

                <br> <br>
                We believe government can able to work well for all level of people. Unfortunately, such dream is far away as the growth of “marginal people with less or no income” in Bangladesh has been on the rise over the past years. However, many charity organizations from home & abroad along with the government have been working hard to improve the quality of life of the marginal people of Bangladesh.
                <br> <br>

                In this situation, in Sep 2011, a visionary man Engineer Moqbul Hussain Patwary,  Balshid, Shahrasti, Chandpur, Bangladesh, established a charitable organization on a decision to devote himself towards “people with Poor or No income’’ (the marginal people of Bangladesh) with the aim to make their life self-reliant. The term self-reliant denotes the improvement of the 5 basic needs of the marginal people of Bangladesh.

                <br> <br>
                The voluntary organization i.e., “Engineer Moqbul Foundation (EMF)” is a non-profit, non-political organization. The foundation uses its vision and ideas for real solutions that break the barriers to meet community needs and boost government in meaningful ways. It projects on long-term community development rather than short-term benefits as many other charities do; as the saying goes “It’s not how much we give but how much love we put into giving”

                <br> <br>

                The “Engineer Moqbul Foundation (EMF)” works All together with community people, international voluntary organization(s) and Government by developing various innovative “self-reliant social programs”. The foundation connects underprivileged but diligent people from all over the country to inspire each other, share success, learn, build relationship, and transform community system.

                <br> <br>
                The overall aim and objectives of Engineer Moqbul Foundation (EMF) is to focus on improving the living standards of those on Poor to no incomes. The Foundation works at the grassroots level in villages or wards for social, cultural, health care, educational, and environmental development of underprivileged rural and urban communities including ethnic minority.
